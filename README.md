# First Challenge
 
For our first challnege we were asked to make some changes to a website. 
I started off by cloning the starter code.
After, I completed the following Acceptance Criteria...

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

By... 

Changing the <div> tags with sematic elements like <body>, <article>, and <nav>.
I based the semantic tags on where the text was on the page. 
I then made sure to give all images an alt tag right after the src element so the page was more accesible. 
I made sure that the <h> elements were labeled in chronological order in the html. 
At the beggining of the html document I changed the title to marketing help site so that the title was more descriptive.
